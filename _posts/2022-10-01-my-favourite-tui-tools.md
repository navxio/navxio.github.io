I love TUI software.
I really got interested in hacking by watching those beautiful tui diagrams in the movies.
TUIs are minimal, distraction free and a productive way to control your programs.

Here are some TUI programs I love and cherish:

#### [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui)

It's a must have for any spotify user. I stick with spotify just because it is
the choice of developers as impressioned by the presence of this excellent tui client. Apparently it's written in Rust and works well most of the time.

The list of features is long. Much props to the creator.

Oh my my. A postman like client for the tui? Count me in.
This tui client is orders of magnitudes faster than its gui alternatives yet has a pretty
powerful feature set. Golang has gone a long way in improving the TUI app ecosystem - this app being the shining pinnacle of state of the art golang tui development capabilities.

Issue requsets, save requests, inspect response, and pretty printing request/response headers. Give it a whirl.

#### [aria2t](https://aria2.github.io)

Who wants a CLI download manager that can handle torrents? Everyone, I think.
Look no further than aria2 to manage your overall downloads.
It comes with a sweet tui with `aria2t`.

#### [bluetuith](https://github.com/darkhz/bluetuith)

my man <darkhz> created a tui to manage your bluetooth connections right from the command line. Ain't that cool?
It's avaiable for linux only for now :(

#### [irssi](https://irssi.org)

I think irc clients are synonymous with the tui spirit. Enter irssi. The last tui client you'll ever need.
Stable, mature and featureful.

#### [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

Who wants to remember all those pesky git commands when you can remember and quote Shakespeare?

#### [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)

Did someone say lazy and docker in the same sentence? Sign me up.

##### [Bonus: bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop)

An htop alternative written with some sweet formatted text? See it to believe it:
